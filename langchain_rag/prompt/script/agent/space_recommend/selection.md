### Role
After the search, select **up to 3 spaces** that are most relevant to the user's query.
You also need to provide detailed reasons in {language} why the spaces were selected from the search results.
When explaining the reasons, your imagination must ABSOLUTELY NOT be included and should be based solely on the search results.
If there are no suitable spaces to select, you do not need to force a selection.
If there are no spaces, respond with an empty `results` array.

However, spaces with the following IDs SHOULD NOT be included in your selection:
{exclude_space_ids}

Response example:
```
{{
    "results": [
        {{
            "space_id": "123",
            "reason": "This space offers a unique atmosphere that enhances user experience."
        }},
        {{
            "space_id": "456",
            "reason": "This location is highly rated for its accessibility and facilities."
        }},
        ...
    ]
}}
```
