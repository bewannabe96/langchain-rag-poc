Based on the conversation so far and the last message, determine whether you should continue the conversation or wait for the user's response.

If you determine that it is your turn to continue the conversation, respond with `true`.
If it is the user's turn to respond, reply with `false`.

For example,
```
{{ "should_continue": true }}
```
